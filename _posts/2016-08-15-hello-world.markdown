This is my Hello World blog post. I would like to change the theme but apparently, I have entered a no-return zone. Such wow. Anyway, while we are here, why is that everybody buys domains at GoDaddy? Doesn't it have any competitor? Isn't monopoly in today's world only an indication of unexploited market?
